# -Machine-Learning-Full-Pipeline-on-Heart-Disease-Sprints
This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for heart disease prediction using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, clustering analysis, and deployment via a Streamlit web app.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, label encoding categorical features, feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical summaries, correlation heatmaps, and visual insights.

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA for variance retention analysis.

Feature Selection: Random Forest, XGBoost, RFE, and Chi-Square tests.

Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM with evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC & AUC.

Unsupervised Learning: K-Means clustering (Elbow method), Hierarchical clustering (Dendrogram analysis) with label comparison.

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV for performance optimization.

Model Deployment: Best-performing model (SVM) saved as a .pkl pipeline including preprocessing for reproducibility.

Interactive Web App: Streamlit UI allowing real-time predictions from user inputs and dataset visualization.
